Spines Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spines is a software research platform that allows the deployment of
overlay networks in the Internet. Spines instantiates overlay nodes on
participating computers and creates virtual links between these
nodes. Many Spines overlays can coexist in the Internet, and even overlap on some
of the nodes or links. Both the source and the destination of a
connection that uses Spines should be part of the same Spines overlay
network.

Spines runs a software daemon on each of the overlay nodes. The daemon
acts both as a router, forwarding packets toward other nodes, and as a
server, providing network services to client applications. Clients
use a library to connect to a Spines daemon and send and receive
messages. The API is very similar to the Unix Socket interface.
Virtually any socket-based application can be easily adapted to work
with Spines. Spines API provides TCP and UDP-like functions for both
reliable, and best effort communication.

A spines_socket() call returns a socket, which is actually a TCP/IP
connection to the daemon. The application can use that socket to bind,
listen, connect, send and receive, using Spines library calls
(e.g. spines_send() is the equivalent to the regular send() call,
etc.). In the current implementation, the maximum size of a message 
that can be sent through Spines is 1400 bytes.

Each application can be uniquely identified in the overlay by the pair of 
IP address of the node it is connected to, and an identifier at that node, 
which we call port. The port of an application is either assigned automatically 
by the overlay node upon application connect, or it is set explicitly by the 
application in a call similar to the Unix bind(). Both reliable and best effort 
unicast communication between two applications connected to the overlay are 
done using the IP address and the port described above in a way similar to 
TCP and UDP. Note that the port of an application is only defined in 
relationship with a Apines overlay node, and is not related to an operating system 
port of the computer the application, or the daemon is running on.

A multicast group is defined as a class D multicast address. If an application 
intends to join a group, it informs its server (overlay node) about this, and the 
server will pass to the application the messages sent to that group. Leaving a group 
follows a similar procedure. In order to multicast a message to a group, an 
application simply sends the message (through its server) to the multicast address 
representing the group. The overlay network handles the routing of the multicast 
message according to the current membership of the group the message is sent to. 
Applications can join, leave, send and receive messages to and from multicast groups 
at any time. An application can join multiple groups, thus it can be member of more 
than one group at the same time. An application does not need to be a member of a 
group in order to send messages to that group.


Spines Daemon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NAME
    spines - The Spines software daemon 


SYNOPSIS
    spines [-p spines_port] [-l local_address] [-a destination] 
    [-a destination]...] [-w <Route_Weight>] [-sf] [-m]
    [-x time_to_live] [-u up_down_interval]


DESCRIPTION
    spines starts an overlay daemon. In the current distribution,
    overlay networks are built incrementally. When staring a new
    overlay node/daemon, the user needs to specify in the command line
    to which other existing nodes (if any), this daemon will connect.


OPTIONS
    -p spines_port 
          The port on which the daemon will send and receive messages
          (default 8100). All the daemons in a Spines overlay network
          need to run on the same port.

    -l local_address
          Local IP address that will be used by Spines (default the
          address of the first defined network interface).

    -a destination
          The address of an existing node participating in a Spines
	  overlay network. The current daemon will create an overlay
	  link together with the daemon running at this address.
	  A Spines daemon accepts overlay link requests
	  from other daemons up to 255 links per node.
    
    -w Route_Weight 
          sets the route metric for shortest path computation.
          Route_Weight can be [distance, latency, loss], with 
          default: distance

    -sf
          Stream based fairness for reliable links. Makes an overlay
          reliable link behave as multiple streams (individual streams
          that actually go through the link) with regard to the TCP
          congestion control
    -m    
          Accept monitor commands for setting losses (see setloss program) 

    -x time_to_live
          Sets the time (in seconds) until the daemon will exit. If no
          such time is given, the daemon will run indeffinitely.

    -u up_down_interval
          Sets an interval (in seconds) at which the daemon will
          switch from normal operation to sleep, and reverse. During
          sleep operation the daemon is considered partitioned away as
          it will drop all the packets received from other daemons.

NAME
    spines_socket - Opens a connection to a Spines Daemon


SYNOPSIS 
    #include "spines_lib.h"

    int spines_socket(int port, int address, int *flags);


DESCRIPTION
    The spines_socket() function opens a connection to a Spines daemon
    defined by the combination 'port' and 'address', and returns a
    socket to the application. The socket returned can be used for
    sending, receiving, binding to a port, etc. by means of functions
    provided by the Spines API. The flags paramerter defines the type of
    overlay links used by the application, and it can be UDP_LINKS or 
    RELIABLE_LINKS. 


RETURN VALUE
    The spines_socket() function returns a socket defining the
    connection to the Spines daemon, or -1 in case of an error.

DESCRIPTION
    spines_sendto() is used to send a message to a Spines
    socket. 'buff' points to the begining of the packet and 'len' is
    the length of it. The destination client should be connected to a
    daemon running on a computer specified by 'address', and should
    bind to the Spines port specified by 'port' in order to receive
    the packet.


RETURN VALUE
    spines_sendto() returns the number of bytes sent or -1 if an error
    occured.



=====================================================================
