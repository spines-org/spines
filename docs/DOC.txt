Spines Documentation 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spines is a messaging infrastructure that allows multi-hop communication
(unicast, multicast, and anycast), and deployment of virtual topologies on
real networks. Spines instantiates a virtual router node on every
participating computer and creates virtual links between these nodes. Packets
are routed automatically in through the network topology. Many Spines
topologies can coexist in the same physical network, and even overlap on some
of the nodes or links.

Client applications connect to one of the router nodes (usually the closest)
and send and receive messages from that node. Spines is responsible to forward
application messages towards the nodes that have destination applications. If
multiple applications intend to communicate using Spines, they must connect to
nodes of the same Spines network.

Spines runs a software daemon on each of the router nodes. The daemon acts
both as a router, forwarding packets toward other nodes, and as a server,
providing network services to client applications. Clients use a library to
connect to a Spines daemon and send and receive messages. The API is almost
identical to the Unix Socket interface. Virtually any socket-based application
can be easily adapted to work with Spines. Spines API provides TCP and
UDP-like functions with similar semantics for both reliable, and best effort
communication.

A client can communicate with a daemon via TCP, UDP, or IPC (Inter-Process
Communication). IPC uses unix socket domains (not available on Windows-based
architectures), and was added to Spines in version 5.1.

For IPC communication, the Spines daemon binds to two file paths, one for the
control channel and one for the data channel. The control channel binds to the
default or user-specified path (e.g., /tmp/spines8100), and the data channel
binds to the control channel path with a "data" suffix (e.g.,
/tmp/spines8100data). Clients just need to specify the (normal) control
channel path; the data channel path is handled automatically. Normally, the
Spines daemon unlinks and cleans up the paths it creates. However, in case of
a hard daemon crash that is not handled, the files must be cleaned up
manually. 

A spines_socket() call returns a socket, which is actually a connection to the
daemon. The application can use that socket to bind, listen, connect, send and
receive, using Spines library calls (e.g. spines_send() is the equivalent to
the regular send() call, spines_recv() is equivalent to recv(), etc.).

When connecting to a daemon using spines_socket(), the client specifies several
options (as part of the protocol parameter) to specify the type of connection.
For example, the client can specify the type of link protocol used to send its
messages between daemons in the Spines network, the type of dissemination
semantics to use, and the type of session semantics to apply to its messages
(currently, this last option only applies to intrusion-tolerant reliable
communication). Full details of these options can be found in the
spines_socket() specification.

Each application can be uniquely identified in the topology by the pair of
(Logical ID, Virtual Port). Currently, the logical ID of an application is the
IPv4 IP address of the daemon it is connected to, and the virtual port is an
identifier at the daemon. The virtual port of an application is either
assigned automatically by the server node upon application connect, or it is
set explicitly by the application in a call similar to the Unix bind(). Both
reliable and best effort communication between two applications connected to
the Spines network are done using the IP address and the virtual port
described above in a way similar to TCP and UDP. Note that the virtual port of
an application is only defined in relationship with a Spines node, and is not
related to an operating system port of the computer the application or the
daemon is running on.

A multicast group is defined as a class D multicast address and an anycast
group as a class E address. If an application intends to join a group, it
informs its server (router node) about this with a spines_setsockopt() call.
From there on, the server will pass to the application the messages sent to
that group. Leaving a group follows a similar procedure. In order to
multicast/anycast a message to a group, an application simply sends the
message (through its server) to the multicast/anycast address representing the
group. The Spines network handles the routing of the multicast message
according to the current membership of the group the message is sent to.
Applications can join, leave, send and receive messages to and from multicast
groups at any time. An application can join multiple groups, thus it can be
member of more than one group at the same time. An application does not need
to be a member of a group in order to send messages to that group.

Spines can also manage kernel routing tables by updating native kernel routes
with those determined by the overlay topology and the chosen metric. In this
case, Spines is acting as an overlay routing daemon where regular user packets
(without any knowledge of Spines) are routed seamlessly in kernel-level
between overlay nodes. As data packets are not processed by Spines, they are
not copied to user-space, and therefore the routing overhead is substantially
reduced. This reduction in CPU consumption can greatly benefit low cost
routers, such as the Linksys WRT54G. Note that, in this mode, certain Spines
protocols cannot be activated as packets are routed by the underlying kernel
services. In addition, kernel-routing services are available in Spines to
support anypath and multipath routing based on group membership.

Documentation about the new intrusion tolerance capabilities added in version
5.0 (and refined in versions 5.1 and 5.2) can be found in DOC_Intrusion_Tolerance.txt.

The current version of Spines was tested to run on Linux X86 computers. 



Spines Daemon 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NAME 
     spines - The Spines software daemon


SYNOPSIS 

     spines [-p spines_port] [-l logical_id] [-I local_address] [[-a destination]*]
            [[-d discovery_address]*] [-w Route_Type] [-tf] [-sf] [-m] [-x time_to_live]
            [-U] [-W] [-k level] [-lf log_file] [-ud unix_domain_path] [-pc]
            [-rl <rate (kbps)>] [-c config_file]


DESCRIPTION 

     spines starts a virtual router daemon. In the current
     distribution, Spines networks are built incrementally. When
     staring a new node/daemon, the user needs to specify in the
     command line to which other existing nodes (if any), this daemon
     will connect.


OPTIONS 

    -p spines_port
          The port on which the daemon will send and receive messages
          (default 8100). All the daemons in a Spines network need to
          run on the same port.

    -l logical_id
          The logical ID of this node

    -I local_address
          Local IP address that will be used by Spines (default the
          address of the first defined network interface).

    -a destination
          The address of an existing node participating in a Spines
          network. The current daemon will create a virtual link
          together with the daemon running at this address.  A Spines
          daemon accepts virtual link requests from other daemons, up
          to 255 links per node.

    -d discovery_address
          The IP-multicast address used to auto-discover other Spines
          daemons. A discovery packet is multicasted periodically to
          allow Spines routers that can hear each other to interconnect.
          A node can specify up to 10 different discovery addresses.

    -w Route_Type
          Sets the route metric for shortest path computation.
          Route_Weight can be [distance, latency, loss, explat, problem],
          with default distance.

          distance: every link has an equal cost of 1. The routing
          minimizes the number of hops on each path.

          latency: the cost of a link is equal to its latency. The
          routing minimizes the total latency of each path.

          loss: the cost of each link is defined as -log(1-p), where p
          is the loss rate of that link. The routing chooses paths
          that minimize end-to-end loss rate.

          explat: The cost of each link equals the expected latency of
          packets on that link, considering that lost packets will be
          attempted to be recovered only once. The routing maximizes
          end-to-end delivery ratio within a time constraint for
          packet delay.

          problem: the absolute value of the cost of each link equals
          the expected latency of packets on that link (same as
          explat), but the sign of the cost indicates whether the link
          is currently considered "problematic". A link is classified
          as problematic (negative weight) if its loss rate exceeds a
          defined threshold, or if its latency exceeds the "base case"
          latency specified in the configuration file by a defined
          threshold. Otherwise, the link is classified as normal
          (positive weight). This route type must be used if routing
          based on dissemination graphs with targeted redundancy (see
          spines_socket below) is desired.

    -tf 
          Turn on TCP fairness. Prior to version 5.3 of Spines, TCP
          fairness was always enforced. As of Spines 5.3, TCP fairness
          is turned off by default, but per-link rate limiting is
          enforced (see -rl option below)

    -sf
          Stream based fairness for reliable links. Makes a reliable
          link between two neighbors behave as multiple streams
          (individual streams that actually go through the link) with
          regard to the TCP congestion control

    -m
          Accept monitor commands for setting link characteristics
          in order to create virtual topologies (see setlink program).

    -x time_to_live
          Sets the time (in seconds) until the daemon will exit
          gracefully. If no such time is given, the daemon will run
          indefinitely.

    -U
          Unicast only. Instructs the daemon to use Dijkstra for route
          computation instead of Floyd Warshall (all pairs shortest
          path). This allows faster route computation and scalability
          to more router nodes (up to 1000), but Spines will not be
          able to route multicast messages.

    -W
          Wireless mode.  Will change some default timers to better
          accommodate a wireless environment.

    -k level
          Sets the kernel routing level that should be used when
          manipulating kernel routing tables.  By default, Spines routes
          packets through a user-level router. This option allows Spines
          to control kernel routing tables according to the following
          levels:

          0 -- Set kernel routes to every node in the Spines network.
               This allows Spines to manage kernel routes through the
               overlay topology.
          1 -- Set unicast kernel routes based on a anycast group
               membership.  By default, 247.0.0.0/8 will map to routes on
               a 10.0.0.0/8 network.  One route entry (on the main route
               table) with one next-hop is entered for each destination.
          2 -- Set unicast kernel routes based on a multicast group
               membership. By default, 227.0.0.0/8 will map to routes
               on a 10.0.0.0/8 network.  For each destination, multiple
               routes (in different routing tables), each with possibly
               multiple next-hop, are entered.

    -lf log_file_name
          Name of the log file to use. If no log file name is given, Spines
          does not log to file.

    -ud unix_domain_path
          Name of the file path where Spines will bind a unix domain socket
          for accepting client connections over IPC. The default path is
          /tmp/spines<port#>, which is /tmp/spines8100 on the default port.
          By specifying -ud, Spines will instead bind to the exact path that
          is listed (the port will NOT be appended in this custom-defined case).
          Additionally, the user can specify a custom unix_domain_path using
          the configuration file.

    -pc
          Print cost statistics periodically. When this option is
          turned on, the Spines daemon tracks how many packets it
          sends for each client (based on destination daemon and port)
          and prints that information periodically.

    -rl rate_limit (in Kbps)
          Limit the sending rate on each link to specified rate_limit.
          The default is 500,000 Kbps. Use a rate_limit of -1 to turn
          off rate limiting. (To get default behavior prior to Spines
          5.3, use -rl -1 and -tf).

    -c configuration_file_name
          Name of the configuration file to read from. The default configuration
          file name is spines.conf. If no configuration file is found, Spines will
          continue with the default parameter values for the link protocols and
          dissemination protocols. Note that without a configuration file, the
          Intrusion Tolerant Link protocol and both the Priority Messaging and
          Reliable Messaging dissemination protocols will be turned off.

NAME spines_init - sets the default Spines server for the library


SYNOPSIS
       #include "spines_lib.h"

       int spines_init(const struct sockaddr *serv_addr);

DESCRIPTION 
       spines_init defines the default Spines server that will
       be used in subsequent spines_socket() calls, unless
       otherwise specified.

       serv_addr represent the address of the Spines server.
       Currently, spines_init supports 3 options:
       (1) serv_addr points to a struct sockaddr_in* (family = AF_INET)
       (2) serv_addr points to a struct sockaddr_un* (family = AF_UNIX)
       (3) serv_addr is NULL, in which default is used. 
       
       On Unix systems, the default (serv_addr == NULL) is to use IPC over
       Unix domain sockets. On Windows systems, the default behavior
       is to use a TCP connection (AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM) to the daemon's
       IP address based on a gethostbyname() function call.

RETURN VALUE
       -1 is returned if an error occurs; otherwise it returns 1

NAME spines_socket - create an endpoint for communication with Spines


SYNOPSIS
       #include "spines_lib.h"

       int spines_socket(int domain, int type, int protocol,
			 const struct sockaddr *serv_addr);

DESCRIPTION 
       spines_socket creates an endpoint for communication and returns
       a descriptor.

       The domain parameter specifies a communication domain; this
       selects the protocol family which will be used for
       communication.  The currently understood formats include:

       Name		   Purpose
       PF_SPINES	   Regular Spines communication

       The socket has the indicated type, which specifies the
       communication semantics. Currently defined types are:

       SOCK_STREAM
              Provides sequenced, reliable, two-way, connection-based
              byte streams.

       SOCK_DGRAM
              Supports datagrams (connectionless, unreliable messages
              of a fixed maximum length).

       The protocol specifies both the communication protocol between
       the client application and the Spines daemon, and the protocol
       used by the Spines daemons to forward messages initiated from
       this particular socket. The protocol is specified as a binary
       OR between two flags:

       Communication between the client application and the daemon:
       TCP_CONNECT
		   TCP communication

       UDP_CONNECT
		   UDP communication

       Message forwarding between the Spines daemons for this
       particular socket uses a link protocol and a dissemination
       protocol:

       Link Protocols:
       UDP_LINKS
                   Best effort forwarding

       RELIABLE_LINKS
                   Messages are sent reliably between daemons

       SOFT_REALTIME_LINKS
                   Message losses are attempted to be recovered, but
                   only if they are likely to be recovered within a
                   certain time frame

       INTRUSION_TOL_LINKS
                   Messages are sent reliably between daemons and can be
                   cryptographically protected (configuration option).
                   The link provides protection against a potentially
                   compromised endpoint by forcing each packet
                   acknowledgement to contain evidence that the packet
                   was actually received.

       Dissemination Protocols:
       MIN_WEIGHT_ROUTING:
                   Stateless routing protocol based on link-state routing

       SOURCE_BASED_ROUTING:
                   Source-based routing protocol. Each packet is
                   stamped with a bitmask specifying the links it
                   should be sent over (its dissemination graph) when
                   it is created at its source. Supported routing
                   schemes are: flooding, k node-disjoint paths, and
                   targeted-redundancy dissemination graphs (see
                   spines_setsockopt below).

       IT_PRIORITY_ROUTING:
                   Stateful intrusion-tolerant routing protocol based on
                   source-based routing, providing timeliness guarantees
                   and priority semantics independently for each active
                   source. Messages can be cryptographically protected
                   (configuration option).

       IT_RELIABLE_ROUTING:
                   Stateful intrusion-tolerant routing protocol based on
                   source-based routing, providing end-to-end reliable
                   message delivery, using back-pressure to stop new
                   messages from entering the network when buffers are
                   full, until existing messages are delivered. Messages
                   can be cryptographically protected (configuration
                   option).

       When using IT_RELIABLE_ROUTING, the client can specify to its connected
       Spines daemon the type of semantics to apply to its messages when
       sending to a destination (different Spines daemon) that is undergoing
       back-pressure, i.e., buffers for that destination are full:

       Session Semantics (for IT_RELIABLE_ROUTING):
       RELIABLE_STREAM_SESSION
                   These semantics are best suited for applications that desire
                   reliable in-order communication to a single destination. 

                   Messages are sent reliably between the client and its
                   connected Spines daemon. If the flow buffer from this daemon
                   to the destination has room, the message is added and sent.
                   If the buffer is full, we store the message (for later use)
                   and block the entire session toward all destinations until
                   this flow has space for the stored message.

       RELIABLE_DGRAM_SESSION_NO_BACKPRESSURE
                   These semantics are best suited for applications that
                   simultaneously send to multiple Spines destinations that do
                   not want to be blocked when a destination's flow buffer
                   becomes full. The no back-pressure option is appropriate for
                   applications that do not need to know whether messages were
                   accepted (able to fit in the flow buffer) at their connected
                   Spines daemon.

                   Messages are sent reliably between the client and its
                   connected Spines daemon. If the flow buffer from this daemon
                   to the destination has room, the message is added and sent.
                   If the buffer is full, the message is silently dropped. Note
                   that no message is stored for later and no feedback is given
                   to the client. It is presumed that the client will handle
                   any consequences accordingly.
                   
                   NOTE: These semantics are currently experimental and may be
                   subject to change in future versions.

       RELIABLE_DGRAM_SESSION_WITH_BACKPRESSURE
                   These semantics are best suited for applications that
                   simultaneously send to multiple Spines destinations that do
                   not want to be blocked when a destination's flow buffer
                   becomes full. The back-pressure option is appropriate for
                   applications that need to know whether messages were
                   accepted (able to fit in the flow buffer) at their connected
                   Spines daemon.

                   Messages are sent reliably between the client and its
                   connected Spines daemon. Explicit feedback for each message
                   is given to the client. This indicates whether or not the
                   daemon had space in the (destination-specific) flow buffer
                   to accept a client's message. 
                   
                   NOTE: These semantics are currently experimental and not in
                   the open-source. Please contact us if you want to know more
                   details.
                   
       By default, if the Protocol is set to zero, Spines will use TCP_CONNECT,
       UDP_LINKS, MIN_WEIGHT_ROUTING, and RELIABLE_STREAM_SESSION.

       Different sockets connected to the same or different Spines
       daemons can use different values for their protocol parameter.
       
       The location of the Spines daemon is denoted by serv_addr. Currently,
       clients can connect using two distinct families: AF_INET and AF_UNIX. 
       If serv_addr points to a struct sockaddr_in, then AF_INET will be chosen 
       and the client connects over TCP or UDP (depending on the other flags).
       If serv_addr points to a struct sockaddr_un (on Unix-based systems), then
       AF_UNIX will be chosen and the client connects using IPC. 
       
       If serv_addr is set to NULL, then the address set by spines_init()
       is used (see spines_init description). If spines_init() was not
       called explicitly, then the default connection method is IPC on Unix-based 
       machines and TCP (localhost on port 8100) on Windows-based machines.
       
RETURN VALUE
       -1 is returned if an error occurs; otherwise the return value
       is a descriptor referencing the socket.

NAME
       spines_close - Closes a connection to Spines


SYNOPSIS
       #include "spines_lib.h"
  
       void spines_close(int sk);


DESCRIPTION
       Closes a connection to Spines, defined by the socket 'sk'.


RETURN VALUE
       NONE



=====================================================================

NAME
       spines_bind - bind a name to a Spines socket

SYNOPSIS
       #include "spines_lib.h"
  
       int spines_bind(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *my_addr, 
                       socklen_t addrlen);

DESCRIPTION
       spines_bind gives the socket sockfd the local address
       my_addr. my_addr is addrlen bytes long. When a Spines socket is
       created with spines_socket, it has a virtual port automatically
       assigned by the Spines daemon. This virtual port can be changed
       through the spines_bind call.

       It is normally necessary to assign a local address using
       spines_bind before a SOCK_STREAM socket may receive connections
       (see spines_accept).

RETURN VALUE
       On  success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned.

NAME

       spines_sendto - Sends a message to a Spines socket


SYNOPSIS
       #include "spines_lib.h"

       int  spines_sendto(int  s,  const void *buf, size_t len, int flags, 
                          const struct sockaddr *to, socklen_t tolen); 


DESCRIPTION
       spines_sendto is used to send a message to a Spines
       socket. 

       The parameter s is the file descriptor of the sending socket.
       buf points to the beginning of a buffer and len is the length
       of it. The destination client is identified by the parameter
       to. The parameter flags is not yet used.

RETURN VALUE
       spines_sendto returns the number of bytes sent or -1 if an
       error occurred.



=====================================================================

NAME
       spines_recvfrom - Receive a message from a Spines socket


SYNOPSIS
       #include "spines_lib.h"

        int spines_recvfrom(int s, void *buf, size_t len, int flags, 
                            struct sockaddr *from, socklen_t *fromlen);


DESCRIPTION
       spines_recvfrom is used to receive a message from a Spines
       socket.  

       If from is not NULL, the source address is filled in.  The
       argument fromlen is a value-result parameter, initialized to
       the size of the buffer associated with from, and modified on
       return to indicate the actual size of the address stored there.


RETURN VALUE
       spines_recvfrom returns the number of bytes received, or 
       -1 in case of an error



=====================================================================

NAME
       spines_connect - Initiates a connection on a Spines socket


SYNOPSIS
       #include "spines_lib.h"

       int spines_connect(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *serv_addr, 
                          socklen_t addrlen);



DESCRIPTION
       This call attempts to make a connection to another socket.  The
       other socket is specified by serv_addr, which is an address (of
       length addrlen) in the communications space of the socket.
       Generally, connection-based protocol sockets may successfully
       connect only once.
 

RETURN VALUE
       If the connection succeeds, zero is returned. On error, -1
       is returned.



=====================================================================

NAME
       spines_send - Sends reliable data through the Spines network 


SYNOPSIS
       #include "spines_lib.h"

       int spines_send(int s, const void *msg, size_t len, int flags)


DESCRIPTION
       spines_send is used to transmit a message to another Spines
       socket. The send call may be used only when the socket is in a
       connected state (so that the intended recipient is known). The
       parameter s is the file descriptor of the sending socket. The
       message is found in msg and has length len. flags is currently
       not used.



RETURN VALUE
       spines_send returns the number of bytes sent or -1 if an error
       occurred.



=====================================================================

NAME
       spines_recv - Receives reliable data through the Spines network 


SYNOPSIS
       #include "spines_lib.h"

       int spines_recv(int s, void *buf, size_t len, int flags);


DESCRIPTION

       The parameter s must refer to a Spines socket that is already
       connected to some other Spines socket. 'buf' defines a memory
       address where the message can be stored, and 'len' is the
       available size for the message. flags is currently not used.

RETURN VALUE
       spines_recv returns the number of bytes received or -1 if an
       error occurred.



=====================================================================

NAME
       spines_listen - Listens for a connection on a Spines socket 


SYNOPSIS
       #include "spines_lib.h"

       int spines_listen(int s, int backlog);


DESCRIPTION
       To accept connections, a socket is first created with
       spines_socket, a willingness to accept incoming connections is
       specified with spines_listen, and then the connections are
       accepted with spines_accept.  The spines_listen call applies
       only to sockets of type SOCK_STREAM. The  backlog parameter is 
       currently not used. 


RETURN VALUE
        On success, zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned.



=====================================================================

NAME
       spines_accept - Accepts a connection on a Spines socket 


SYNOPSIS
       #include "spines_lib.h"

       int spines_accept(int s, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *addrlen);

    

DESCRIPTION
       The accept function is used with connection-based socket types
       (SOCK_STREAM). It extracts the first connection request on the
       queue of pending connections, creates a new connected socket
       with mostly the same properties as s, and allocates a new file
       descriptor for the socket, which is returned. The newly created
       socket is no longer in the listening state. The original socket
       s is unaffected by this call.

       The argument s is a socket that has been created with
       spines_socket, bound to a local address with spines_bind, and
       is listening for connections after a spines_listen.

       The argument addr is a pointer to a sockaddr structure. This
       structure is filled in with the address of the connecting
       entity, as known to the communications layer. The addrlen
       argument is a value-result parameter: it should initially
       contain the size of the structure pointed to by addr; on return
       it will contain the actual length (in bytes) of the address
       returned.  When addr is NULL nothing is filled in.

       If no pending connections are present on the queue, accept
       blocks the caller until a connection is present.

       In order to be notified of incoming connections on a socket,
       you can use select or poll. A readable event will be delivered
       when a new connection is attempted and you may then call accept
       to get a socket for that connection.



RETURN VALUE
       The call returns -1 on error.  If it succeeds, it returns a
       non-negative integer that is a descriptor for the accepted
       socket.



=====================================================================

NAME
       spines_setsockopt - Sets the options for a Spines socket


SYNOPSIS
       #include "spines_lib.h"

       int spines_setsockopt(int s, int level, int optname, 
                             const void *optval, socklen_t optlen);


DESCRIPTION

       The spines_setsockopt call is currently used for controlling
       multicast and anycast communication. The parameter s refers to the
       socket connected to Spines, and has to be of type SOCK_DGRAM. The
       rest of the parameters will depend on optname:

       SPINES_ADD_MEMBERSHIP 
           Joins a multicast or anycast group. The optval and
           optlen should refer to the ip_mreq struct containing the
           multicast/anycast group.

       SPINES_DROP_MEMBERSHIP 
           Leaves a multicast or anycast group. The optval and
           optlen should refer to the ip_mreq struct containing the
           multicast/anycast group.

       SPINES_MULTICAST_LOOP 
           Turns on/off the multicast loopback. The optval and optlen
           should refer to a u_char boolean parameter where 0=off and 1=on

       SPINES_SET_PRIORITY
           Sets the priority level that will be assigned to all future messages
           using the IT_PRIORITY_ROUTING dissemination protocol. Valid
           priority levels are between 1 and 10 (inclusive), where 10 is the
           highest priority.

       SPINES_SET_EXPIRATION
           Sets the expiration time for all future messages using the
           IT_PRIORITY_ROUTING dissemination protocol. Meta data for
           messages are stored at spines daemons until they expire in order
           to prevent message replay attacks from potentially malicious
           neighbors.

       SPINES_DISJOINT_PATHS
           Sets the number of node-disjoint paths to use for all
           future messages using SOURCE_BASED_ROUTING,
           IT_PRIORITY_ROUTING, or IT_RELIABLE_ROUTING. Spines
           currently supports values between 0 and 6 (inclusive). A
           value of 0 represents flooding on the overlay, values 1-5
           (inclusive) represent 1 to 5 node-disjoint paths, and 6
           represents dissemination graphs with targeted redundancy.

           The dissemination-graph scheme uses two disjoint paths in
           the normal case, but if problems are detected (using
           "problem" type routing) at a source or destination, the
           protocol switches to a dissemination graph that adds
           targeted redundancy around the problematic source and/or
           destination.

       Spines multicast address space is from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
       (Class D address). Spines anycast address space is from 240.0.0.0 to
       254.255.255.255 (Class E address).


RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned.

NAME
       spines_ioctl - Manipulates Spines router 


SYNOPSIS
       #include "spines_lib.h"

       int  spines_ioctl(int s, int  level,  int  optname,  
               const  void  *optval, socklen_t optlen);


DESCRIPTION

       The spines_ioctl call allows applications to manipulate internal
       parameters of the Spines overlay router.  Currently, ioctl
       can be used to dynamically add Spines neighbors. For example,
       an application can decide when and who should the Spines router
       connect to.

       The parameter s refers to the socket connected to Spines, and has
       to be of type SOCK_DGRAM. The rest of the parameters will depend
       on optname:

       SPINES_ADD_NEIGHBOR
           optval and optlen should refer to a sockaddr type address
           that holds the IP address of the Spines neighbor that the
           node should connect to.


RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned.
