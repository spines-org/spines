This is the v0.9.1 (July 2001) distribution of the stdutil library.

Note, that for v1.0.0 I intend to pretty much destroy any backward
compatability, as I have a growing distaste for my naming conventions
and function/type names. So just be warned, you may want to wait
for that version -- although it could be several months before I
get around to and finish it.

Changes since v0.9.0 (Nov 2000):

Wrote more documentation on the data structures, including an HTML
interface. Changed build system to be a bit more autoconf'ish.  
Rearranged structure of distribution a little.

DESCRIPTION:

The stdutil library is a toolkit of C data structures and functions.

LICENSE: 

The license for use of the stdutil library or its code is contained in
the file STDUTIL_LICENSE found in the root of this distribution.

DOCUMENTATION:

Simply open up index.html with a browser or visit
http://www.cnds.jhu.edu/software/stdutil or look directly at the man
pages contained in the man/ directory.

BUILDING: 

To build this library run make in the root of this distribution. This
will build stdutil.a and several test programs and place them,
respectively, in the bin and lib directories of this distribution. 

*** Anybody who wants to contribute a more complex build and install
setup, please feel free, as this is not one of my strong points. ***

To build a checked or debug version of the library edit src/Makefile.in
before running make. There you can uncomment definitions for the
variables STD_USE_EXCEPTIONS, STD_CONSTRUCT_CHECKS, STD_BOUNDS_CHECKS
and STD_SAFE_CHECKS. The effects of these different variables is either
self-evident or described in Makefile.in.

INSTALLING:

Feel free to move the library and documentation to your standard system
directories. Then go into the src directory and do a recursive copy of
the _DIRECTORY_ stdutil into a standard include path (e.g. cp -r
src/stdutil /usr/include).

LINKING:

Just make sure the include files are available and link with
libstdutil.a.

PROBLEMS:

Please report bugs and/or bug fixes to jschultz@cnds.jhu.edu with a
gdb compatible core (if possible) and any information that could help
me fix the problem in my distributions.

Enjoy,
John Schultz <jschultz@cnds.jhu.edu>
