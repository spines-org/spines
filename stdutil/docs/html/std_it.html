<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
A std_it is an abstract type that describes several iterator types
defined by the stdutil library (e.g. - stdarr_it, stdcarr_it,
stddll_it and stdhash_it). An iterator is a common design pattern used
to represent a sequence of values contained in a data structure. The
main purpose of an iterator is to allow for unique iteration through
all of the values contained within a data structure. However,
iterators can also be used in many other operations as well.
<P>
Any data structure that supports unique iteration through all of its
values defines a sequence on those values at the time of iteration. If
the structure S contains n values, then each contained value in S can
be uniquely associated with an integer rank in the range [0, n), which
is equal to the number of values in S that precede it in the
sequence. 
<P>
For the stdutil library, multiple iterations on the same data
structure instance that occur without intervening structural
operations on that instance see the same rank sequence of values.
Furthermore, many stdutil data structures define precise semantics on
how iterators and the rank sequence of the structure are affected by
structural changes (see each structure's documentation).
<P>
The stdutil is modeled loosely after C++'s STL library, which uses
iterators extensively. In both the stdutil and STL libraries there are
three types of iterators: forward, bi-directional and random-access
iterators. See each stdutil data structure's documentation for what
type of iterator it provides.
<P>
A forward iterator allows some basic operations and tests, but in
general only allows the iterator to move forward (increasing rank) in
the data structure's sequence. A simple singly linked list should only
provide a forward iterator, for example. A bi-directional iterator is
a forward iterator, but also allows the iterator to move backwards
(decreasing rank) in the structure's sequence. A simple doubly-linked
list should provide a bi-directional iterator, for example. A
random-access iterator is a bi-directional iterator that allows for
arbitrary offset and comparison of sequence ranks. A tightly packed
array of values should provide a random-access iterator, for example.
<P>
A data structure's iterator implementation should attempt to support
the broadest class it can, while maintaing expected O(1) space and
time overhead for each of its basic operations (next, previous and
offset, respectively).
<P>
In the stdutil library, an iterator must be correctly initialized by a
data structure instance before it can legally be used. All operations
on that iterator are then done in the context of the initializing
instance. The results of using an iterator initialized by one instance
with another instance are undefined. Likewise, the results of calling
iterator functions (such as
<B>std_it_compare</B>)

on iterators initialized by different structure instances are
undefined.
<P>
<H2>FORWARD ITERATORS</H2>

<P>
A forward iterator is the most restricted class of iterator and
supports the following operations in expected O(1) space and time.
<P>
<B>std_it_val</B>

returns a pointer to the value to which this iterator is currently
referencing.
<P>
<B>std_it_equals</B>

returns stdtrue if the two iterators are referencing the same value.
<P>
<B>std_it_is_begin</B>

returns stdtrue if the iterator is referencing the beginning of the
sequence. The beginning of a sequence is defined as the first value in
the sequence or the end of the sequence if it is empty.
<P>
<B>std_it_is_end</B>

returns stdtrue if the iterator is referencing the end of the
sequence. The end of a sequence is defined as one position past the
last value contained in the sequence (rank n). It is illegal to call
<B>std_it_val</B>

on the end of sequence.
<P>
<B>std_it_seek_begin</B>

sets the iterator to reference the beginning of the sequence.
<P>
<B>std_it_seek_end</B>

sets the iterator to reference the end of the sequence.
<P>
<B>std_it_next</B>

advances the iterator forward one position in the sequence.
<P>
<B>std_it_advance</B>

advances the iterator forward
<I>num_advance</I>

positions in the sequence. This operation should execute in O(1) space
and 
O(<I>num_advance</I>)

time.
<P>
<H2>BI-DIRECTIONAL ITERATORS</H2>

<P>
A bi-directional iterator is a forward iterator that also supports the
following operations in expected O(1) space and time.
<P>
<B>std_it_prev</B>

retreats the iterator back one position in the sequence.
<P>
<B>std_it_retreat</B>

retreats the iterator back
<I>num_retreat</I>

positions in the sequence. This operation should execute in O(1) space
and 
O(<I>num_retreat</I>)

time.
<P>
<H2>RANDOM-ACCESS ITERATORS</H2>

<P>
A random-access iterator is a bi-directional iterator that supports
the following operations in expected O(1) space and time.
<P>
<B>std_it_offset</B>

offsets the iterator 
<I>offset</I>

positions forward in the sequence. If 
<I>offset</I>

is negative, then it retreats the iterator that many positions.
<P>
<B>std_it_compare</B>

compares two iterators and returns the offset in sequence rank needed
to move from
<I>it2</I>

to
<I>it1</I>.

For example, say
<I>it1</I>

is referencing the value with rank 2 and 
<I>it2</I>

is referencing the value with rank 5, then 
<B>std_it_compare</B>

(<I>it1</I>, <I>it2</I>)

would return -3.
<P>
<H2>RETURN VALUES</H2>

<P>
When called legally, none of the above functions can fail. Most of the
functions' return values are described in the SYNOPSIS. The functions
that return std_it *'s return the
<I>it</I>

passed to them to allow for function composition.
<P>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

<P>
For performance reasons, by default the stdutil library does no usage
checking. It assumes the programmer knows what s/he is doing and
doesn't want additional overhead incurred from sanity checks.
<P>
However, the library can be built will several types of checks,
including bounds and initialization checks that can catch many common
programming mistakes. See the README file included with the stdutil
library distribution to see how to create such a &quot;checked&quot; or debug
library.
